## Project Report: Iteration 2 Alternate Path
 

### Reflection
This jam has pushed me farther than I have ever gone before. Several extra does of coffee and various unexpected background noise stimulants kept me working well into the night. This is a game I feel really proud of, regardless of the pain developing it. I even showed this game to several friends and they seemed to enjoy it a lot more than prior projects. Some of my goals while developing was to try and really use all of the Godot knowledge I have. I think I really managed that here. The time pressure really brought out the desperation to do better. I think if I continued the first half of Project 2 I think it would have been lesser than this game.
